# Blockquote Styling Test

This file demonstrates the three new blockquote styles.

## Regular Blockquote (Single `>`)

Standard blockquotes with the default gray left border:

> This is a regular blockquote. It has a simple left border and some indentation.
> Multiple lines work as expected.

## Pull Quote (Double `>>`)

Magazine-style pull quotes with larger, emphasized text:

>> The pattern is almost comically consistent: deploy without security, expose to the internet, and wake up to a billion-record breach.

More text here after the pull quote to show how it flows.

>> Pull quotes stand out from the text and draw attention to key points. They're perfect for highlighting important statements or memorable quotes.

## GitHub Alerts

GitHub-style alert boxes with icons and semantic colors:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note. It provides additional context or information that readers might find helpful.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip. Use it to share best practices or shortcuts that can help users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important information that users should pay attention to.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning. It alerts users to potential issues they might encounter.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution message. Use it for actions that could have negative consequences.

## Marginalia (Triple `>>>`)

Sidenotes shown via indicator (hover/tap the † symbol to reveal):

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

>>> This is a margin note that appears as a popover when you hover over the dagger symbol.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

>>> Marginalia are perfect for asides, footnotes, or supplementary information that doesn't belong in the main text flow.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

>>> On mobile devices, tap the † symbol to see the note. On wide screens, the note appears in the margin.

## Mixed Content

Regular blockquote:
> Standard quote

Pull quote:
>> Emphasized pull quote with larger text and prominent styling

Marginalia:
>>> A side note

And back to regular content.
