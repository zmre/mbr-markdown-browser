# TODO

## What's Next

* [ ] Reveal.js has a new major version, 6.x, we need to update to it
  * API stays the same
  * The HTML and CSS are *not* wildly changed: v6 removes zero CSS classes (adds two), and `.reveal > .slides > section` plus every `Reveal.initialize()` option are unchanged. The real work is our three `reveal.theme.*.css`, which are patched forks (Source Sans Pro `@import` stripped, globals removed so they inherit from Pico; `blank` has no upstream counterpart at all) and would need re-deriving against v6 — where themes now inline their fonts as base64, taking `black.css` from 7 KB to 575 KB, so the strip is worth keeping.
  * `scripts/update-assets.sh --reveal 6.0.1` handles the mechanical part (core + `dist/reveal.css` + the notes plugin, which moved to `dist/plugin/notes.js`) and deliberately leaves the themes alone.
* **Relationships & genealogy** (see [docs](docs/markdown/relationships.md))
  * [ ] Edit-mode support for structured person data: a friendlier way to view/edit the person frontmatter (born, died, born_place, gender, aliases, relationships) than hand-editing raw YAML in the in-browser editor — e.g. a small form for the known fields.
  * [ ] Wire the editor to the person `image` frontmatter field — pick/replace the portrait. Image upload itself is done (`editor-crepe.ts` `uploadFile` → `POST /.mbr/upload`, reachable from the upload button, drag-drop and paste), but every result path targets a ProseMirror body node; nothing writes a frontmatter key, so the portrait is still set by hand-typing `image:` into the raw YAML textarea.

* **Tasks** (see [docs](docs/markdown/tasks.md))
  * [ ] Scan for `TODO:` / `FIXME:` style markers in source files as well as markdown checkboxes, driven by a configurable list of regexes. Deferred from TASKS_SPEC.md's opening paragraph; needs a decision on what "a task" means when there is no checkbox to toggle. Note there is already a configurable marker list to build on — `incomplete_markers` (default `TK`/`TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX`) — but it only decorates rendered HTML in `markdown.rs`; the task index (`tasks.rs`) recognizes checkbox lines only, and `task_index.rs` never opens a non-markdown file.

* [ ] Should we allow tabs for viewing multiple markdown files in one session (gui)?
* [ ] CriticMarkup support?
* [ ] Use light background default and light mode when printing. The print stylesheet itself is done (`theme.css` `@media print`, documented in docs/customization/themes.md), but it never forces a light color scheme — colors still follow the page theme and theme.css just leaves a "use light mode" tip for the user.
* [ ] Export to PDF
  * _After research, my options here are pretty ugly. I don't want to compile in chromium or anything and don't want to rely on it being installed in a common place, either. Current browser widget I use doesn't give me a print to pdf option. Need to look for a reasonable way to make this happen cross platform with reliable output._
  * Start with the current page as an option.
  * Also allow a print to PDF for the whole site (essentially taking a doc site and compiling everything into chapters in a single PDF).
  * All of this to live only in the GUI app via menu bar items with cmd-<key> shortcuts.
  * Printing of the compiled book too (plain per-page printing is already there: File → Print, cmd/ctrl+P, `webview.print()`)
  * On MacOS, printing would probably be enough because the user could export to PDF, but because this is cross-platform, it would be nice if we can find a good way to do this anywhere.
  * CLI tool should support direct markdown to PDF options, too, including for the "book" mode compiling all markdown listed in a sidebar into a single document.
  * When building a book, start with a full page title page then a page with the table of contents, then the converted markdown in any specified order or default order. Align with the GUI for ordering and labeling.
  * Make sure to handle edge cases like extra long titles.

* **Big repo (goodwiki) issues**
  * [ ] Finish pagination — the browse components have it, nothing else does. Done: `mbr-browse` middle pane and `mbr-browse-single` top-level folders/root files (100 per page + "Show more"), the media browser (200), and tag pills. Still unbounded: the recursive folder tree in both components, `_renderDynamicSections`, the hierarchical tag tree, and every server-rendered template — `home.html`, `section.html`, `tag.html` and `tag_index.html` all loop the complete list with no slice.
    * [ ] `sidebar_max_items` is dead config. It's validated in `config.rs` and injected into every template context, but no template ever emits a `max-items` attribute, so the components always fall back to their hardcoded 100.
    * [ ] The home page no longer enumerates the whole site to render — it's scoped to direct children and falls back to a non-recursive scan while the background scan runs. What still blocks is the sidebar: `shared.ts` fetches `/.mbr/site.json` on every page, and that handler awaits `wait_for_scan()`.
  * [ ] wikilinks and the link checker: underscore-prefixed files (e.g., _...Baby One More Time Tour.md) - files with special chars were renamed with underscores but internal links weren't updated -- none of those work yet. not sure what to do
    * Need to look into the spaces vs. underscores stuff a bit here too
    * Answer: only if we submit PRs to pagefind or switch to something else
  * [ ] Media scanning / populating media metadata is slow on large repos. Images take 2 to 10ms. PDFs can take a whole minute. Video files 30 to 50ms.  In practice, on the Magic repo, it takes many minutes (10?) to complete a first pass. The parallelism half is done — population is rayon-parallel and runs as a later phase of the background scan, so `site.json` no longer waits on ffmpeg/lopdf. What's left is the actual cost, and the suspicion in this item was right: nothing reads headers only.
    * [ ] PDFs get fully parsed **twice** by `lopdf::Document::load` — once in `pdf_metadata.rs` for `Info` + page count, again in `repo.rs` for search text. Wants a trailer/incremental read and a single pass.
    * [ ] Images go through the same ffmpeg-backed `MediaFileMetadata::new` as video, even though the `image` crate is already a dependency and could read dimensions from the header.
    * [ ] Nothing is lazy: `populate_media_metadata` walks every entry in `other_files` up front rather than on demand.
    * [ ] No faster-library evaluation has happened yet (`metadata`, `ffmpeg-next`, `lopdf` all unchanged).
    * [ ] `/.mbr/media.json` still hard-blocks on `wait_for_media()`, so the media browser is unusable for the entire ~10 minutes rather than filling in progressively.

* [ ] We should change it so on open of the app without any specified dir (or the root as assumed), we pop up some sort of splash page where the user can select from recents or select open. Maybe give some info on the app. Today that case shows a bare `rfd` native folder picker and exits on cancel (`main.rs` `needs_folder_picker`/`show_folder_picker`) — that's the stopgap to replace. Nothing tracks recently-opened *folders*; the only "recent" list is recently-viewed files within a repo, in localStorage.

* **Publish**
  * [ ] Publish to a homebrew cask?
  * [ ] Publish to determinate's flake hub?
  * [ ] Any publishing to linux repos?

* **Windows**
  * [ ] Consider a hybrid CRT: static vcruntime + *dynamic* UCRT. The `+crt-static` in `.cargo/config.toml` fixes the missing-VCRUNTIME140.dll crash on clean installs, but it also freezes the UCRT into the binary, so the UCRT security fixes Microsoft ships via Windows Update never reach mbr.exe. Tauri does the hybrid for this same wry/tao/webview2 stack, and [rust#153568](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/153568) proposes it as the Windows default. Not free: the link args differ between release (`/nodefaultlib:libucrt.lib` + `ucrt.lib`) and debug (the `...d.lib` variants), and config-file rustflags cannot vary by profile — `cargo test` on the Windows CI legs is a debug build — so doing it properly means a build-script dependency such as `static_vcruntime`. The existing CI import assertions work unchanged either way.

* [ ] Need to produce robots.txt and/or sitemap.xml files (robots pulled from .mbr so user can override)? We would need some custom frontmatter to cause something to be left out or even ignored. We also need to use last update or date field to push into sitemap too.  But our "everything is relative" idea falls apart since the sitemap needs to know the full URL of the content (hostname, prefix path, etc.) so maybe we'd only build it if that's specified.

* [ ] Pull in lightningcss and auto combine and minify the pico.min.css + theme.css + user.css files.
